## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Development Setup

1. Install dependencies and run the dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

2. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

3. Useful scripts (from package.json):

```bash
npm run dev    # start dev server
npm run build  # build for production
npm run start  # start production server after build
```

## Files of interest

- `app/page.tsx` — main page and dialog wiring
- `components/form/userForm.tsx` — dynamic form renderer
- `components/ui/date-picker.tsx` — date picker used for `date` fields
- `lib/users-form.ts` — field configuration (add fields here)
- `lib/user.schema.ts` — dynamic Zod schema built from the config
- `hooks/users.ts` — TanStack Query hooks and mutation handlers
- `app/api/users` — example in-memory API routes

## How to add a new field (quick)

1. Open `lib/users-form.ts` and add an entry to the `userFields` array. Example:

```ts
{
	name: "dateOfBirth",
	label: "Date of Birth",
	type: "date",
	required: false,
}
```

2. The UI will automatically render the correct input based on `type` and `component`:

- `type: "date"` → the date picker component is rendered and submits `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- `component: "select"` → a select dropdown is rendered; add an `options` array.
- default → text/number/email/tel input is rendered.

3. Validation is auto-generated by `lib/user.schema.ts` based on the field type and `required` flag. You usually do not need to edit the schema.

4. The form submission sends the field with other form values to the API. The in-memory API (`app/api/users`) stores data in `globalThis.users` for demo purposes.

Example select field with options:

```ts
{
	name: "country",
	label: "Country",
	type: "text",
	component: "select",
	options: [
		{ label: "United States", value: "us" },
		{ label: "Canada", value: "ca" },
	],
	required: true,
}
```

## Notes, assumptions & design decisions

- Configuration-driven: `lib/users-form.ts` controls form fields. Adding or removing fields is done only in that file.
- Validation: `lib/user.schema.ts` builds a Zod schema from the config. Common rules applied:
  - `email` → `.email()` validation
  - `tel` → digits-only and exactly 10 digits (adjust the regex if you want E.164)
  - `date` → must be a valid date string
  - `number` → string input validated as numeric (convert before submit if you need actual numbers)
  - `required: true` → enforces non-empty
- UI: `components/form/userForm.tsx` reads the config and renders inputs dynamically. Special components are used for `select` and `date` types.
- Data handling: `hooks/users.ts` uses TanStack Query and `userApi` (axios) for server communication. The example server is in-memory and resets on restart.

## Next steps / optional improvements

- Persist data to a real database (replace in-memory API handlers in `app/api/users`).
- Convert number fields to submit as actual numbers (modify `hooks/users.ts`).
- Make phone validation configurable per-field if you need multiple phone formats.

## Deployment
